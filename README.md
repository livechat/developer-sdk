## üì¶ Installation

Use the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package managers to install the developer-sdk package in your project.

```bash
npm install -g @livechat/developer-sdk
# or
yarn global add @livechat/developer-sdk
```

The NPM package is distributed both as a CommonJS and ES6 module. It should be used together with a module bundler, such as Webpack or Rollup.

We also distribute a UMD build of the package, which can be used directly in the browser.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@livechat/developer-sdk@latest/dist/developer-sdk.umd.min.js"></script>
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Application config

Developer application bootstrapped from our template can use autogenerated developer application config:

```ts
import appConfig from './livechat.config.json';
```

Developer application config can be also created manually:

```ts
const appConfig: DeveloperAppConfig = {
  appId: 'xxxxx',
  auth: {
    clientId: 'yyyy',
  },
};
```

2. Application instance

```ts
const app = await DeveloperApp.init(appConfig);
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting started

```ts
app.utils.reporting.notifyUserActivity();
app.utils.reporting.sendError(ErrorType.5xx);
app.utils.reporting.sendEvent(...);

```
